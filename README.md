-- =============================================
-- One major factor that contributed to the significant number of Unicorn in 2021 is the Global Pandemic (COVID-19) which restricted movement and instigated a lockdown
-- COVID-19 accelerated digital adoption in 2021, boosting Fintech and Internet Software & Services.
-- Lockdowns increased demand for digital payments, online banking, and remote tools,
-- leading to a surge in unicorns in these sectors due to rapid growth and investor interest.
```
- Pre-2021 trends (normalization)
```sql
-- The significant emergence of Unicorn Companies in 2021 can be traced down to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
-- Events like the COVID-19 pandemic are not regular occurences, hence 2021 was excluded from this analysis helps avoid skewed data, 
-- which could introduce bias and misrepresent trends in industry investment. 
-- Focusing on 2012‚Äì2020 ensures consistency and reliability of insights.
